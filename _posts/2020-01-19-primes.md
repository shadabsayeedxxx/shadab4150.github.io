# Dirichlet's theorem and Prime's Polar Representation.
## How pretty but pointless patterns in polar plot of primes prompt pretty important ponderings on properties of those primes.

* In number theory, Dirichlet's theorem, also called the Dirichlet prime number theorem, states that for any two positive coprime integers a and d, there are infinitely many primes of the form a + nd, where n is also a positive integer. In other words, there are infinitely many primes that are congruent to a modulo d. The numbers of the form a + nd form an arithmetic progression

### [Dirichlet's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet%27s_theorem_on_arithmetic_progressions)
* In **number theory**, **Dirichlet's theorem**, also called the **Dirichlet prime number theorem**, 
  states that for any two positive coprime integers a and d, there are infinitely many primes of the form **a + nd**, 
  where **n** is also a positive integer. 
  In other words, there are infinitely many primes that are congruent to **a modulo d**. 
  The numbers of the form **a + nd** form an **arithmetic progression**

##   a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d,

* and Dirichlet's theorem states that this sequence contains infinitely many prime numbers.
  The theorem, named after Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, extends Euclid's theorem that there are infinitely many prime numbers. 
  Stronger forms of Dirichlet's theorem state that for any such arithmetic progression, 
  the sum of the reciprocals of the prime numbers in the progression diverges and that different such arithmetic progressions with the 
  same modulus have approximately the same proportions of primes. 
  Equivalently, the primes are evenly distributed (asymptotically) among the congruence classes modulo d containing a's coprime to d.

* Dirichlet's theorem does not require that the sequence contains only prime numbers. The Theorem deals with infinite sequences.
