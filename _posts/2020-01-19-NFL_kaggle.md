# NFL ML model to predict yards gained

* In the National Football League (NFL), roughly a third of teamsâ€™ offensive yardage comes from run plays.

* In this project, I tried to develop a model to predict how many yards a team will gain on given rushing plays as they happen.

## In this project we will do analysis of NFL Big Data Bowl Dataset.
